def get_page_summary(wiki_page):
    """
    Retrieves a brief summary of a given Wikipedia page.

    This function takes a Wikipedia page object and returns the summary of the page. However, rather than 
    returning the entire summary, it returns only the first few lines. This is particularly useful for 
    getting a quick overview or introduction to the page's content without needing to process the entire 
    summary text.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wiki_page : WikipediaPage object
        A Wikipedia page object from which the summary is to be extracted. The object should have a 'summary' 
        attribute containing the text of the page's summary.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A string containing the first few lines of the Wikipedia page's summary. The exact number of lines 
        returned is set to 5 in this implementation.

    Selects a random Wikipedia page that meets certain validity criteria.

    This function repeatedly requests random Wikipedia pages until it finds one that satisfies specific 
    criteria: the title should not start with certain prefixes (like "Template:", "List of", etc.), should 
    not contain certain unwanted characters, and must contain at least one alphabetical character. The 
    function also checks if the page has a reasonable summary (at least 20 words) before accepting it.

def validate_pages(wiki_page):
    """
    Filters and validates the linked pages from a given Wikipedia page.

    This function takes a Wikipedia page object and extracts all the links (or references to other Wikipedia 
    pages) from it. It then filters out unwanted links based on predefined criteria, such as links with 
    certain prefixes (like "Template:", "Wikipedia:", etc.) and links that do not contain any alphabetical 
    characters. The purpose is to retain only relevant and potentially useful page links for further processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wiki_page : WikipediaPage object
        A Wikipedia page object from which the links are to be extracted and validated. The object is 
        expected to have a 'links' attribute containing a dictionary of linked page titles.

    Returns
    -------

        prefixes and contain at least one alphabetical character.

    """
    Identifies the most similar strings to a reference string from a list of candidate strings.

    This function computes the similarity between a reference string and each string in the candidate list. 
    It uses a model to generate embeddings for the reference and candidate strings, and then calculates 
    the cosine similarity between the reference embedding and each candidate embedding. The function 
    returns the top 'n' most similar strings and their similarity scores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference_string : str
        The reference string to which the similarity of candidate strings is to be compared.

    candidates_list : list[str]
        A list of candidate strings from which the most similar ones to the reference string are identified.

    n : int, optional
        The number of most similar strings to return. Defaults to 10.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of (list, list)
        A tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the top 'n' most similar strings from the 
        candidates list, and the second list contains their corresponding similarity scores. The similarity 
        scores are in the range [0, 1], where 1 indicates perfect similarity.
